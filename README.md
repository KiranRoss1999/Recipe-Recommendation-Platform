# CookTube!

## Description
CookTube is a simple website that provides customization to recipe ideas and search options, as well as providing Youtube cooking tutorials based on the user’s recipe search. This first design was created with the intention of being a starter point for anyone and everyone to feel more motivated to cook, and have a variety of recipe options available to suit what they're feeling like on the day.

Don't know what to cook but you have a main ingredient to use? You can search for that. Looking for vegetarian for your friend but don't know any recipes? We have a search for that too. While other website such as this exist, this comes without the overwhelming content bombing, ads, and complex UI or need to jump between multiple pages, leaving just the desired product and the user.
